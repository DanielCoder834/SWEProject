# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Here is a description for the most important files

## Frontend Structure Description

### CSS Files
- **App.css**: Controls the overall aesthetic of the website, defining the layout for pages such as Home, Register, and Login. It sets background colors, positions the top menu, spreadsheet, and navigation buttons.

### TypeScript Files
- **App.tsx**: The root component that handles routing and state management throughout the application. It integrates all major components like TopMenu, Spreadsheet, and user-specific views (User, Moderator, Admin).

- **home.component.tsx**: Displays the main page, accessible through the "Husksheets" link. It primarily renders the Spreadsheet and TopMenu components.

- **auth.service.tsx**: Provides authentication services, facilitating communication with the backend for user login and registration.

- **register.component.tsx**: Manages user registration, allowing new users to create accounts. If an account already exists, it notifies the user but logs them in regardless.

- **login.component.tsx**: Handles user login, validating credentials and initiating user sessions with success messages upon successful login.

- **Topmenu.tsx**: A comprehensive component that includes all functionalities related to spreadsheet manipulation through various buttons, making API calls to the backend to perform these operations.

- **spreadsheets.tsx**: Represents the interactive grid component of the spreadsheet, displaying a 2D array of cells.

- **cell.tsx**: Defines the behavior and presentation of a single cell within the spreadsheet, which users can edit to enter values or formulas.

- **parser1.tsx**: Processes and parses expressions or formulas entered into cells, converting them into a format that can be evaluated or executed.

- **tokenize.tsx**: Tokenizes inputs from cells using predefined regular expressions, categorizing parts of the input for further processing.

- **astnodes.tsx**: Contains class definitions for various node types that represent different parts of parsed expressions, aiding in the evaluation of cell content.
